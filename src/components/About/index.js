            COVID-19 vaccines be ready for distribution

            The vaccines must be proven safe and effective in large (phase III)
            clinical trials. Some COVID-19 vaccine candidates have completed
            their phase III trials, and many other potential vaccines are being
            developed.
            <br />
            Independent reviews of the efficacy and safety evidence is required
            for each vaccine candidate, including regulatory review and approval
            in the country where the vaccine is manufactured, before WHO
            considers a vaccine candidate for prequalification.

            The vaccines must be manufactured in large quantities, which is a
            major and unprecedented challenge â€“ all the while continuing to
            produce all the other important life-saving vaccines already in use.{' '}
            <br /> As a final step, all approved vaccines will require
            distribution through a complex logistical process, with rigorous
            stock management and temperature control.

          <p className="footer-anw">
            In addition to review of the data for regulatory purposes, the
            evidence must also be reviewed for the purpose of policy
            recommendations on how the vaccines should be used.

            Officials in individual countries decide whether to approve the
            vaccines for national use and develop policies for how to use the
            vaccines in their country based on the WHO recommendations.
